# Architecture

The SuperDiff codebase is sufficiently complex
that diving into the source code for the first time may be daunting.

This section aims to point contributors in the right direction.
Since most of the code in this codebase services the RSpec integration,
these guides heavily skew toward that topic,
and you can start with a [guide to how RSpec works if you like](./how-rspec-works.md).
But you can also find [details around the diff engine](./how-super-diff-works.md).
Finally, if you're curious about the files in this project and how they're organized,
feel free to consult the [structure](./structure) document.
