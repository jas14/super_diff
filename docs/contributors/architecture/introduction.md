# Architecture

The SuperDiff codebase is sufficiently complex
that diving into the source code for the first time may be daunting.

This section aims to point contributors in the right direction.
Since most of the code in this codebase is dedicated toward the RSpec integration,
these guides heavily skew toward that topic,
but you can also find details around the diff engine.
