SuperDiff is a gem that hooks into RSpec
to intelligently display the differences between two data structures of any type.

ðŸ“¢ **[See what's changed in recent versions.][changelog]**

[changelog]: CHANGELOG.md

## Introduction

The primary motivation behind this gem
is to vastly improve upon RSpec's built-in diffing capabilities.

Sometimes, whenever you use a matcher such as `eq`, `match`, `include`, or `have_attributes`,
you will get a diff of the two data structures you are trying to match against.
This is great if all you want to do is compare multi-line strings.
But if you want to compare other, more "real world" kinds of values,
such as what you might work with when developing API endpoints
or testing methods that make database calls and return a set of model objects,
then you are out of luck.
Since [RSpec merely runs your `expected` and `actual` values through Ruby's PrettyPrinter library][rspec-differ-fail]
and then performs a diff of these strings,
the output it produces leaves much to be desired.

[rspec-differ-fail]: https://github.com/rspec/rspec-support/blob/c69a231d7369dd165ad7ce4742e1a2e21e3462b5/lib/rspec/support/differ.rb#L178

For instance,
let's say you wanted to compare these two hashes:

``` ruby
actual = {
  customer: {
    person: SuperDiff::Test::Person.new(name: "Marty McFly, Jr.", age: 17),
    shipping_address: {
      line_1: "456 Ponderosa Ct.",
      city: "Hill Valley",
      state: "CA",
      zip: "90382"
    }
  },
  items: [
    {
      name: "Fender Stratocaster",
      cost: 100_000,
      options: ["red", "blue", "green"]
    },
    { name: "Mattel Hoverboard" }
  ]
}

expected = {
  customer: {
    person: SuperDiff::Test::Person.new(name: "Marty McFly", age: 17),
    shipping_address: {
      line_1: "123 Main St.",
      city: "Hill Valley",
      state: "CA",
      zip: "90382"
    }
  },
  items: [
    {
      name: "Fender Stratocaster",
      cost: 100_000,
      options: ["red", "blue", "green"]
    },
    { name: "Chevy 4x4" }
  ]
}
```

If, somewhere in a test, you were to say:

``` ruby
expect(actual).to eq(expected)
```

You would get output that looks like this:

![Before super_diff](docs/before.png)

What this library does
is to provide a diff engine
that knows how to figure out the differences between any two data structures
and display them in a sensible way.
So, using the example above,
you'd get this instead:

![After super_diff](docs/after.png)

## Installation

There are a few different ways to install `super_diff`
depending on your type of project.

### Rails apps

If you're developing a Rails app,
add the following to your Gemfile:

``` ruby
group :test do
  gem "super_diff"
end
```

After running `bundle install`,
add the following to your `rails_helper`:

``` ruby
require "super_diff/rspec-rails"
```

### Projects using some part of Rails (e.g. ActiveModel)

If you're developing an app using Hanami or Sinatra,
or merely using a part of Rails such as ActiveModel,
add the following to your Gemfile where appropriate:

``` ruby
gem "super_diff"
```

After running `bundle install`,
add the following to your `spec_helper`:

``` ruby
require "super_diff/rspec"
require "super_diff/active_support"
```

### Gems

If you're developing a gem,
add the following to your gemspec:

``` ruby
spec.add_development_dependency "super_diff"
```

Now add the following to your `spec_helper`:

``` ruby
require "super_diff/rspec"
```

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the gem
by adding a configuration block
to your test helper file
(`rails_helper` or `spec_helper`)
which looks something like this:

``` ruby
SuperDiff.configure do |config|
  # ...
end
```

### Customizing colors

If you don't like the colors that SuperDiff uses,
you can change them like this:

``` ruby
SuperDiff.configure do |config|
  config.actual_color = :green
  config.expected_color = :red
  config.border_color = :yellow
  config.header_color = :yellow
end
```

See [eight_bit_color.rb](lib/super_diff/csi/eight_bit_color.rb)
for the list of available colors.

### Diffing custom objects

If you are comparing two data structures
that involve a class that is specific to your project,
the resulting diff may not look as good as diffs involving native or primitive objects.
This happens because if SuperDiff doesn't recognize a class,
it will fall back to a generic representation when diffing instances of that class.
Fortunately, the gem has a pluggable interface
that allows you to insert your own implementations
of key pieces involved in the diffing process.
I'll have more about how that works soon,
but here is what such a configuration would look like:

``` ruby
SuperDiff.configure do |config|
  config.add_extra_differ_class(YourDiffer)
  config.add_extra_operation_tree_builder_class(YourOperationTreeBuilder)
  config.add_extra_operation_tree_class(YourOperationTree)
end
```

## Inspiration/Thanks

In developing this gem
I made use of or was heavily inspired by these libraries:

* [Diff::LCS][diff-lcs],
  the library I started with in the [original version of this gem][original-version]
  (made in 2011!)
* The pretty-printing algorithms and API within [PrettyPrinter][pretty-printer] and [AwesomePrint][awesome-print],
  from which I borrowed ideas to develop the [inspectors][inspection-tree].

Thank you to the authors of these libraries!
