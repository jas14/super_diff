# Contributing

Want to make a change to this library?
Great! Here's how you do that.

First, create a fork of this repo,
cloning it to your computer
and running the following command in the resulting directory
in order to install dependencies:

```
bin/setup
```

After this, you can run all of the tests
to make sure everything is kosher:

```
bundle exec rake
```

Next, make changes to the code as necessary.

Code is linted and formatted using Prettier,
so [make sure that's set up in your editor first][prettier-editors],
or you can always fix any lint violations by running:

```
yarn lint:fix
```

[prettier-editors]: https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html

If you update one of the tests,
you can run it like so:

```
bin/rspec spec/integration/...
bin/rspec spec/unit/...
```

Finally, submit your PR.
I'll try to respond as quickly as I can.
I may have suggestions about code style or your approach,
but hopefully everything looks good and your changes get merged!
Now you're a contributor! ðŸŽ‰

## Speeding up the integration tests

The integration tests,
located in `spec/integration`,
can be quite slow to run.
If you'd like to speed them up,
run the following command in a separate tab:

```
zeus start
```

Now the next time you run an integration test by saying

```
bin/rspec spec/integration/...
```

it should run twice as fast.

## Understanding the codebase

If you want to make a change
but you're having trouble where to start,
you might find the [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) document helpful.
